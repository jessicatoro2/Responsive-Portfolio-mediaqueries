      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img id="profilepic" src="assets/images/greece2-me.jpg">
      <p id="bodytext"> I don’t believe ketchup belongs on a hot dog and my vowels are nasally but I don’t hear it. I never had class on Pulaski Day and as a North-sider I’m unapologetic when I supports my Sox at “Comiskey”. If you haven’t guessed already I’m a native Chicagoan; let me be clear, CHICAGO, not "Chicago-land area", not "Chicago suburbs"…[shi-KAH-go]. I couldn’t even bare leaving my beloved city for college and studied Graphic Design at the University of Illinois at Chicago. After graduating from UIC, I decided the city would survive without me and moved to the East coast. I worked as a Graphic Designer on the Medicaid/Medicare Special Projects Team at Social Security Administration’s headquarters in Woodlawn, Maryland (for all you Serial listeners, across the street from THE Best Buy.)<br>
        <br> Although I loved the transient nature of the East coast, old bay and crab cakes were not in my plan. So, after two years in Charm City I packed my bags and moved back to the midwest. I was jobless but happy to be home to reunite with my new love interest. I was head over heals,  cartoon hearts flying out of my head, in love with my then boyfriend, now husband (&#35;thankGodthatworkedout.) After being jobless for a month, I received an offer letter from Northwestern University on my birthday December 18, 2012 and began working for Student Affairs Marketing January 2013. I am currently Assistant Director of Student Affairs Marketing and I love spending my days watching student develop and gain a passion for their craft. In my free time, I enjoy getting over dressed and acting like a foodie, dancing salsa with my husband, and spending way too much money and time buying make-up and watching YouTube tutorials.</p>
